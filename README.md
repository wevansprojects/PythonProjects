# Remote Scripting with Paramiko
Basic paramiko scripting using yaml as input for sensitive data

This set of scripts can be used to test remote scripting using python and the paramiko library
Paramiko is a very handy library for carrying out configuration management tasks.
As is typical with a lot of open source tuitorials you really need to peice together the information
Although my example uses barely any functions or classes it demonstrates what can be done with paramiko
I will certainly upload more complex examples in the near future.
